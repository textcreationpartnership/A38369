         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Wherefore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were ever by the Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Laws of the Land, allowed their Aſſent and Directions in all Elections of Perſons unto thoſe places.</p>
               <p>This right hath been ſtrangely oppugned by divers Popes, ſome of them diſturbing Elections made by the Conſent of the King; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſtowing Biſhopricks at Pleaſure, without Election at all, and againſt the Kings will.</p>
               <p>The firſt that ſtirred that Quarrel in <hi>England,</hi> was <hi>Anſelm</hi> Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> For when the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> needy of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, borrowed of the Clergy great Loans, never to pay again, he to exempt himſelf from Subjection to the King, laboured to make his Archbiſhoprick to depend meerly on the Pope, not on the King, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had acquired it by the Conceſſion and free Gift of the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſelm</hi> then being promoted in the year 1092 to the Archbiſhoprick by King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the King having franckly beſtowed that rich Biſhoprick upon him, ſoon after would extort from him a great Sum of Money for the exigence of his Affairs, as claiming ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his Gift. <hi>Anſelm</hi> refuſed to give it, and ſtealing away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately out of <hi>England,</hi> went to Pope <hi>

               <p>The King being herewith incenſed, Prohibited <hi>Anſelm</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdom, confiſcated the Lands and Eſtate of the Archbiſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, and by an expreſs Edict declared, That the Biſhops held their Places and Eſtates meerly from him, and were not ſubject unto the Pope for the ſame: And that he had the ſame rights in his Kingdom, as the Emperour had in the Empire.

               <p>He came then to Pope <hi>

In the ſame Council he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that thence-forth it ſhould not be lawful for any Prelate, or Eccleſiaſtical Man, to receive the Inveſtiture, or Collation of a Benefice, or Church-dignity, from the hand of any Lay Perſon. But the Princes derided theſe Decrees, and retained the Poſſeſſion of theſe Inveſtitures.</p>
               <p>In the year 1099 King <hi>William</hi> and Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> died. <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt ſucceded <hi>William,</hi> who ſought to be reconciled with <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and called him home again. But <hi>Anſelm</hi> being obliged by an Oath to the Pope, prevailed with the King, that a Council ſhould be gathered at <hi>London,</hi> where he declared the Order he had from the Pope, That no Lay Man ſhould have the Power to confer any Inveſtiture,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109501:10"/> and began to degrade the Biſhops promoted by the Kings Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, refuſing to conſecrate ſome Biſhops named by the King. King <hi>Henry</hi> being highly diſpleaſed, baniſhed him out of <hi>England</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and confiſcated his Goods.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed in <hi>England,</hi> Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> proſecuted the Quarrel of his Predeceſſors againſt the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> IV. He cauſed the Emperors own Son to rebel againſt his Father, who ſoon after dying with Grief, was ſo forſaken, that Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> would not ſuffer him to be buried, for his Carcaſs lay five years at <hi>Spire,</hi> rotting without any Chriſtian Burial.</p>
               <p>The new Emperior <hi>Henry</hi> V, paſt preſently into <hi>Italy</hi> after the Death of his Father, where the Pope hoping to be recompenſed for helping him in his Conſpiracy againſt his Father, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deceived: for when he preſs'd him to renounce the Rights of Inveſtitures, which his Anceſtors (as <hi>Sigebert</hi> ſaith) had enjoyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred years, the Emperor grew very Angry, and laying hold of this Pope <hi>Paſchal,</hi> committed him to cloſe Priſon. Neither would he releaſe him, till he had renounced his claim to the Inveſtitures and Collations of Benefices, ſaying to him in in ſcorn that which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to the Angel wreſtling with him, <hi>I will not let thee go before thou haſt given me thy Bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Paſchal,</hi> to redeem himſelf out of Captivity, granted to <hi>Henry,</hi> that doth he and the Popes after him, ſhould leave unto the Emperors the peaceable enjoying of the Inveſtitures of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Dignities, by the Ring and the Staff. Alſo that none ſhould be Conſecrated Biſhop without an Inveſtiture from the Emperor. The Pope and the Emperor reciprocally bound themſelves by Oath upon the Hoſt of the Maſs, which they received together. But becauſe that Oath was extorted, the Pope thought not himſelf obliged to keep it. So he brake that Agreement, and excommunicated <hi>Henry,</hi> and all Princes uſurping Inveſtitures.</p>
               <p>This accident confirmed <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> in a reſolution to retain the Inveſtitures of his Kingdom. And that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was held in <hi>England</hi> for a long time. Only the Popes, that they might not be injurious to their pretences by a long Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſend the Pall to ſome Prelats inveſted by the King, confirming that which they could not alter, and giving an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which was not ſought from them.</p>
               <p>And further; as to Elections of Biſhops, the great Troubles that were in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> grew upon no other occaſion, than becauſe the King refuſed <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> whom the Pope

And the ſaid Legat had power to Excomunicate all that ſhould refuſe to pay, and to put the Churches in Interdict.

               <p>In theſe Exactions he was ſo urgent and griping, that the Pariſhes were forced to engage the Chalices and Church-Plate to ſatisfie his Covetouſneſs. And he had certain Uſurers with him, who lent Money upon double uſe, to thoſe who had no ready Money. This cauſed a great Clamour and Lamentation over all the Countrey, but without effect. The Money was imployed by the Pope in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading many Towns belonging to the Emperor in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the Emperor could not defend them, becauſe he was ingaged againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the <hi>Levant,</hi> where he took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and put the Affairs of the Chriſtians in a flouriſhing Eſtate. And it is probable, that he had utterly deſtroyed the <hi>Saracens,</hi> if the Injuries which he received from the Pope had not re-called him.

This was done under a pretence of contributing to the expence of the Holy War, of which himſelf hindered the ſucceſs; and yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that ſhould contribute Money for it, the remiſſion of all their ſins, and to them that ſhould go in Perſon, an Augmentation of Glory; yet the Pope never gave any part of the Money raiſed for that expedition, to any Prince that paid Armies, and fought for that Quarrel. All was thrown into the Popes Coffers, as into a Gulph, and by him imployed to make War againſt <hi>Frederick,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:109501:14"/> for he preſently broke the Covenant ſworn unto him.</p>

               <p>At firſt becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the chief City of the Empire, from thence (as from a Seminary) were preachers ſent to ſundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to preach and plant the Goſpel, or to confute Hereſies, afterwards to provide vacant Benefices, and to ſupply the abſence of the Roman Biſhop in <hi>Synods;</hi> in all which they did no other thing but as other Biſhops might have done, and alſo did.</p>
               <p>But when the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were made Patriarchs, and became ambitious, theſe Legats did the ſame Offices at ſome times: but therewith they began craftily to injoyn unto Archbiſhops and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans., to execute ſome things which they were commanded by the Word of God to do; and they would give them power within their own Dioceſſes, as if Biſhops had been Vicars of the Roman Parriarchs, or his Legat.</p>

               <p>Again, the charge of the ordinary Entertainments of a Legat was a great matter, for all his Charges were born by the Realm.

               <p>What benefit the Realm received for all theſe charges upon the <note place="margin">The uſe of Legats.</note> Legats, the Monuments of two of the chief of theſe Legats, <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Ottobon</hi> (I mean their Legantine Conſtitutions, which were the fruits of their Reformation) do well ſhew.

And the caſe between the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> for the Controverſie whether the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> might have a Croſs born before him within the Dioceſs of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (a goodly Matter for Biſhops to contend about) did hang many years in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And likewiſe the Caſe between the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> for the Vale of <hi>Eveſham.</hi> The Decretals are full of Engliſh Caſes, decreed even as the parties found favour in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the poor Cauſe of Matrimony of <hi>Cetwood,</hi> did hang in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was reſerved there by Act of Parliament, and never was decided. And that very point was the occaſion that King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. did look into the Uſurpation of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe the Pope would needs Excommunicate the King for not anſwering in his own Caſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> as is notably diſcovered by <hi>Bellay</hi> in his <hi>Memoires,</hi> who was the Ambaſſador for the French <note place="margin">Bellay <hi>in</hi> Memoires.</note> King in <hi>England,</hi> and was ſent of purpoſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſtay the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and could not get ſix days reſpite; and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe ſix days the Meſſenger came with Inſtructions to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the Matter.</p>

               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> being daily oppreſſed with many intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Grievances, and divers new Devices to extort Moneys more than before, in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, he ſummoneth a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> by reaſon of the Complaints of the Engliſh againſt thoſe Grievances, which they could no longer tollerate without the brand of ſluggiſhneſs, and their own imminent ruin. Great was the Indignation of the Pope againſt the miſerable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, for that they durſt complain againſt their daily injuries and oppreſſions in the Council; which he ſo multiplied, that the Engliſh
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109501:19"/> were more vile in his eyes and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than any other even of the remoteſt Nations: Inſolently ſaying, <hi>It is expedient for us to compound with the Emperour</hi> Frederick, <hi>that we may trample the little King of</hi> England <hi>under our Feet, who now kicks with the heel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Extorting and Collecting ſeveral Sums of Money by General Taxes and Aſſeſſes, without the Kings Aſſent or Conſent, againſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms, Liberties, and Rights of the Realm, and againſt the Appeal and Contradiction of the Proctors of the King and Kingdom made in a General Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In kindering Patrons to preſent their Clerks to Vacant Livings, and beſtowing them by Proviſo's on other Roman Clerks, utterly ignorant of the Engliſh Tongue, to the peril of the peoples ſouls, and impoveriſhing the Realm beyond meaſure, by tranſporting Money out of it.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>In granting Penſions out of Livings by proviſion, and more provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Benefices than he promiſed, after his Bull againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That one</hi> Italian <hi>ſucceeded another, That Subjects cauſes were drawn out of the Realm by the Pope's Authority againſt the Custom of the Realm, againſt the Written Laws; that men ought not to be condemned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Enemies; and againſt Indulgences granted by his Predeceſſors to the Kings and Realm of</hi> England.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The frequent mention of that infamous word,</hi> Non-obſtante <hi>in his Bulls, by which the Religion of an Oath, ancient Cuſtoms, vigour of Writings, the Eſtabliſhed Authority of Charters, Laws, Priviledges, were debilitated, vaniſhed away; and his not carrying himſelf courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly towards the Realm, in revoking the plenitude of his power, as he promiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That in the Benefices of</hi> Italians, <hi>neither their Rights, nor ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the poor, nor hoſpitality, nor preaching of God's Word, nor the uſeful Ornaments of the Churches, nor Cure of Souls, nor Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, were performed as they ought to be; and according to the Cuſtom of the Countrey.</hi>

               <p>To which other Complaints to the King and Parliament againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſuper-added; which they ſent to the Pope by their reſpective Meſſengers, with five ſeveral Letters, two from the King to the Pope and his Cardinals, a third from all the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, a fourth from all the Abbots and Priors, the fifth from all the Earls and Temporal Lords, ſpeedily to reform all their Grievances, to prevent unavoidable Miſchiefs to the King, the Pope, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their revolt from Subjection to them.</p>
               <p>They complained, that the Pope demanded Knight-ſervice due only to the King, to Lords from their Tenants, from Prelats and Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to find him ſo many Horſe or Foot for half a year, or pay a great Ranſom in lien of it, under pain of Excommunication, which they muſt reveal to no Man. That he granted one years Fruits of all Benefices that fell void within the Province of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> to Archbiſhop <hi>Boniface.</hi> That he by ſealed Bulls required the Abbots of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Order in <hi>England,</hi> to ſend him golden Jewels to adorn his Planets and Copes, as if they might be got for nothing. That if any Clerk ſhould from thenceforth die inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, his Goods ſhould be converted to the uſe of the Pope; which he commanded the Friers, Preachers, and Minors, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to execute, ſeizing on the Money, Goods, and Plate of three rich Archdeacons, which the King hearing of prohibited; and by the common Advice of his Nobles and Prelats in Parliament, iſſued ſeveral ſucceſſive Prohibitions to the Abbot of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and others, not to pay any Tallage to the Pope or his Agents, before the return of their Meſſengers to <hi>Rome</hi> againſt theſe Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under pain of ſeizing his Barony: and to the Biſhops, not to exact or levy any ſuch Tax, for any Clerk, Religious Perſon, or Lay-man, to the prejudice of his Royal Dignity, againſt his and his Nobles Proviſions in Parliament, which he neither could nor would indure.</p>
               <p>The Pope contemned the zealous Letters and memorable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the King and whole Kingdom againſt his Exactions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> and others to levy a Subſidy for him, at which all were amazed. The King ſummons a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Winton,</hi> concerning the manifold Grievances of the whole Realm, and eſpecially of the Church; wherein the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſent to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> reported, <hi>That they could diſcern no Humility nor Moderation in the Popes Geſtures or Words, concerning the Oppreſſions wherein the Church and Realm of</hi> England <hi>were grieved,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109501:20"/> 
                  <hi>and whereof they complained. That when they expected a pleaſing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> the Pope told them, <hi>The King of</hi> England, <hi>who now kicks his Heel, and</hi> Frederizeth, <hi>hath his Council, and I have mine, which I will purſue. That from that time ſcarce any Engliſh Man could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch any Buſineſs in Court; yea, they were all repelled, and reviled as Schiſmaticks; ſo as ſo many Epiſtles of the King, and the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Nobles and Prelats of the Realm, had no efficiency at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which Report the King and Nobles being much exaſperated the King by their Advice commanded Proclamations to be made through all Countreys, Cities, Boroughs, and Villages of the Realm, that no Prelate, Clerk, or other Perſon, throughout the Realm, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any Contribution to the Pope, or tranſmit any Money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Aid, or in any wiſe obey his papal Commandement: which was accordingly done.</p>
               <p>The Pope hearing thereof, wrote to the Engliſh Prelats more ſharply than before, requiring them <hi>under pain of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Suſpenſion, to pay in the Aid he demanded, to his Nuncio in the</hi> New Temple <hi>before the Feaſt of Aſſumption.</hi> Hereupon the King was ſo terrified with the Popes Menaces, that he and the Richeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats complied with his Deſigns, paying 6000 Marks to the Pope, to the great impoveriſhing of the Realm; which was tranſported by the Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> and Merchants, to aid the <hi>Landgrave</hi> againſt the Emperor <hi>Frederick;</hi> part whereof he intercepting, grievouſly reprehended the Effeminacy of the Engliſh, and of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> for yielding to the Popes party, to the Deſtruction of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and detriment of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The Pope intended to have interdicted the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> had they not paid his 6000 Marks, and the King by his <hi>Nuncio's</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Compliance to it. Now all the conſolation and hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Engliſh, expired; their Enemies being their Judges.</p>

               <p>In this ſtate (as hath been expreſſed) this Realm ſtood (for the moſt part) by the ſpace of 300 years after the Conqueſt: The times that followed were ſomewhat freed from certain degrees of the Popes Tyranny, by reaſon that the Kings of this Realm armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Laws made in defence of ſome of their ancient Liberties, and Executed others with better Courage than their Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>But I doubt, if God for our ſins ſhould caſt us again under his Yoke, none of thoſe Laws would ſave us from the extreameſt of all thoſe miſchiefs which I have here ſet down. My Reaſons are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Popes are no Changelings, but were the ſame after thoſe Statutes, and are the ſame men that they were before; and to put us out of doubt, made continual claim to their Uſurped Authority in the time of the later Princes.</p>
               <p>For in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth ſent to levy a Subſidy upon the Clergy of this Land, for maintenance of his Wars againſt the <hi>Bohemians.</hi> And he made <hi>Henry Beaufort</hi> the rich Cardinal of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> his Legat for thoſe Wars, who did vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly there for certain moneths together, aſſiſted with the foreſaid Subſidy, until he was re-called by the Pope.</p>
               <p>And two other Subſidies were afterwards required, to perſecute
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109501:23"/> two private perſons of this Realm; <hi>viz. Peter Clerk,</hi> and <hi>William Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fex.</hi> Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. the Cardinal of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Statute againſt Proviſion, procured the Popes Bull to take again his Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which he had loſt by his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip; and after obtained a Pardon from the Pope againſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Statute.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame Prince's Reign, <hi>Lewes</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> after the death of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> had all the Fruits and Revenues of that Biſhoprick granted unto him during life; but was therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the King. Other Examples there be of like ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the laſt Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> there is a ſpecial Conſtitution for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 5. c.</hi> 18.</note> Reſtitution of all Eccleſiaſtical Liberties; and therein the Emperour, all Kings, Princes, and States, are commanded that they ſee them protected.</p>
               <p>The Title of Eccleſiaſtical Liberties, reacheth to every of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Points before touched, and therefore we may conjecture what we are to look for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Pope yearly publiſheth one Excommunication, which is called <hi>Bulla de Coena,</hi> wherein by Name are compriſed all that be any let to ſuch as would proſecute any Suit at <hi>Rome;</hi> or that ſuffer not the Popes Bulls, Commiſſions, and other Proceſſes whatſoever, to be executed. And all that execute any Statutes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to the Liberties of <hi>Rome,</hi> be the cuſtom to the contrary never ſo ancient; and ſuch as impoſe Tenths, Subſidies upon the Clergy, or receive them at their hands with good conſent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pope allow thereof; and thoſe alſo which force any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſon to anſwer before them in Criminal Cauſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lay-Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Martinus ab Azpil, in Enchyridion;</hi> c. 27. Which Book was made by the ſpecial Commandement of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. The warning given us by Bulls publiſhed in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, aſſureth us that if he may have place again, he meaneth not to dally with us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some of our unnatural Countrey-men in ſome deſperate Books of theirs, long ſince caſt abroad againſt the Execution of Juſtice, have not ſpared to tell us, that the Laws made in Catholick times, <hi>viz:</hi> the Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and ſome other, were bad Laws, and not to be allowed. And again, there were found upon ſome which came in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time to diſturb the Peace of this Realm, ſmall Pamphlets, containing Directions (as they would have them taken) for Mens Conſciences, wherein they delivered many things to trouble thoſe perſons whoſe Conſciences
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109501:24"/> were poſſibly in thoſe Points ſtayed, in confidence of the Ancient Laws of this Realm, and upon ſome Grants made by the Pope himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Pope hath challenged a Soveraignty over this Realm, to beſtow it where he liſteth, as feudary unto himſelf, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received a Tribute, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> which was in times of Popery of every Houſe a penny. Whereby <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Book <hi>de Republica,</hi> argueth, that the Realm of <hi>England</hi> is not a Soveraign Eſtate; not to ſpeak of the yearly Tribute paid unto the Pope by King <hi>John,</hi> and ſome other Princes his Succeſſors. This may ſerve the Pope for a mean to bridle all the Old Statutes and the Liberties of our Countrey, and to ſpoil the Prince of all his Prerogatives. We know how he dealt with <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> long agone; wherein it were an hard matter for the proudeſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſide to juſtifie his Title: And that he hath put out, and put in Kings at his will, and ſometime offered their Kingdoms to ſale: And from King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, by the ſhadow of a bare Title, the Pope got infinite ſums of Money, to the great exhauſting of his Treaſure, and impoveriſhing of the Realm.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Stukeley</hi> and <hi>Fitz-moris</hi> were at <hi>Rome,</hi> they and the Pope practiced to give this Realm in Prey, as he did the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Empire from the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> and alſo to get an Inveſtiture of the Realm of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Pope, as of a Soveraign; but they could not agree upon whom the Pope ſhould beſtow that Realm.</p>
